## Overview:
Predict MLB World Series winners based off of regular season performance using predictive analysis and machine learning methods- multivariate linear regression and a neural network- then comparing the results. Specifically, we look at pitching and hitting data for each team from 2000-2020. 

## Instructions to use this repo:
Obtain data:
  1. Download CSV files from Stathead. One for pitching data and one for hitting data.

Populate machine learning methods and results:
 1. Clone this repo to your desktop.
1. Open a terminal window from the directory, 
    > 1. Type ``source activate PythonData``
    > 1. Hit ENTER
    > 1. Type ``jupyter notebook`` 
    > 1. Hit ENTER

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: multivariate linear regression.ipynb and neural_network.ipynb
1. In the notebooks, 
    > 1. Click ``Kernel``
    > 1. Click ``Restart and Run All`` or run each cell one by one
    > 1. In the final cell output, verify data is returned

1. Close the notebook and terminal window.

Run the app:
  1. Either click the link on GitHub to access our site, or you can run the file in VS code and r-click on the index.html to see a live preview.

## Reference
Data taken from [Stathead Baseball.](https://stathead.com/baseball/team-season-finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&order_by_asc=0&order_by=HR&year_min=1980&year_max=2021&output_type=standard&type=b)
This is a subscription based baseball statistic database but a month-long free trial is available for accessing and downloading data.
